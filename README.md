# Cofee-Shop-Implementation-By-Using-Queue-Data-Structure
The Cofee Shop is available in two different models, each model with N cashiers and N/3 baristas.
For the first model there is one queue for both Cashier and Barista.
For the second model, there is one queue for cashiers and N/3 queues for baristas.
First 3 cashiers send the orders to the first barista and next 3 cashiers send the orders to the second barista and goes on like that.
